                Most of our vehicles can accommodate a foldable wheelchair. Please
                consider the space it takes in the trunk along with your luggage.
                Mention it in the 'Special Instructions' before confirming your
                booking. For fully accessible vehicles, look for the ramp symbol.
                If you need one, be sure to specify it in the 'Special
                Instructions' before confirming your booking.

              For an airport pickup, how far after I land should I ask to get
              picked up?
            </h3>
            <p class="blog-description">
              We suggest a pickup time for your convenience. If you have
              luggage, book 30-40 minutes after landing, or 20 minutes if you
              have only a carry-on. For international flights, add 30-60 minutes
              for customs. Call the driver once you land to let them know youâ€™ve
              arrived.
